A media management app for developers.  

CURRENTLY A DANGEROUS PROGRAM TO USE. WAIT UNTIL ELECTRON PORT (If it ever comes).

## Description

Wanted to create a pseudo desktop-app using ReactJS. Foresight is a tool meant to make media/asset management for your projects easier. Files are given unique, editable, keys that can be used to access said file no matter what directory it's in. Before you build your file, you may choose to change all of your unique paths into automatically resolved filepaths to their correct directory. This allows you to organize and move files around your project freely without having to worry about updating your media directories until the very end.

### Dependencies

* React
* Express
* Webpack
